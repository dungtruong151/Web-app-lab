            <h2>Here to Slay (2020)</h2>
            <p>
                <em>
                    <strong>Here to Slay</strong>
                </em>
                is a competitive role-playing fantasy strategy card game that's all about assembling a party of Heroes and slaying monsters (and sometimes sabotaging your friends too) from the creators of Unstable Unicorns.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this game, you’ll assemble a full party of heroes to slay dangerous monsters while working to avoid the sabotage of your foes. The game also includes items you can equip to your heroes, 1V1 challenge cards, and roll modifiers to tip the odds in your favor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first person to successfully slay three monsters, or build a full party with six classes, wins the game!
            </p>
            <p>
                Every player gets to choose a party leader character to represent them throughout the game. Each party leader card has a class and a skill that gives you an edge over your opponents. Whether you enjoy fighters, bards, wizards, or thieves, you'll find a party leader that's right for your play style - but choose wisely, because you only get one party leader for the whole game!
            </p>
            <p>
                Your heroes are brave adventurers, ready to attack monsters and go head to head with your foes! The game includes over 40 unique heroes. Each hero card has a class and an effect, and each hero’s effect has a roll requirement. In order to use a hero’s effect, you must roll two dice and score equal to or higher than that effect’s roll requirement. Heroes take advantage of items, magic and modifiers to increase their chances of making their dice rolls.

                <em>You are head of a family in an Italian city-state, a city run by a weak and corrupt court. You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive...</em>

                , you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence – i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Duke:</strong>
                    Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assassin:</strong>
                    Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contessa:</strong>
                    Block an assassination attempt against yourself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Captain:</strong>
                    Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ambassador:</strong>
                    Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:
            </p>
            <ul>

                    <strong>Income:</strong>
